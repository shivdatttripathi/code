# Daily Task Tracker

## Overview

The **Daily Task Tracker** is a simple and interactive web-based task manager designed to help users track their daily activities. Users can mark tasks as started and completed, with timestamps automatically recorded and stored using `localStorage`.

## Features

- **Date Selection**: Users can select a date to view or update tasks.
- **Task Management**: Tasks are displayed in a visually appealing grid layout.
- **Start & End Time Logging**: When a task is started or completed, the time is recorded.
- **Local Storage**: Task statuses persist even after a page refresh.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI adjusts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the page
- **CSS**: Styling for a visually appealing layout
- **JavaScript**: Handles interactivity, time tracking, and local storage

## How It Works

1. **Load the Page**: The current date is pre-selected, and tasks for the day are loaded.
2. **Select a Date**: Users can pick another date to track tasks on different days.
3. **Mark Tasks**:
   - Clicking the **Start checkbox** logs the start time.
   - Clicking the **End checkbox** logs the completion time and visually marks the task as completed.
4. **Storage**: Data is saved locally, so progress is retained even if the page is refreshed.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Ability to add/edit tasks dynamically
- [ ] Cloud-based storage for better accessibility
- [ ] Notifications and reminders
